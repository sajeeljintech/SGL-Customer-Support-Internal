# Create New Customer Folder

Each customer has a folder to house their signed license agreement to use the software.&#x20;

The customer folders are housed in the Documents portion of the Shared Point page.&#x20;

To create a new folder, choose the New button. A list of choices will appear. The first option, New Folder, is the one you want to choose.

A popup will appear for you to enter the name of the new folder. We name the folders for show companies by their individual show name. In this popup, you will enter the new name and choose create.

Your new folder will be in the list by alphabetical order.&#x20;

Then, you can create the license agreement for the customer and store this here.&#x20;
