# Facility Permissions

Since we have decided to change the facility permissions for all show companies, when a new company is set up, we will have to manually change the facility permission so they cannot edit facilities. The following is a set of step by step instructions to change the facility permissions.

## Steps:

1. Log into the RDP connection to access the client software for the new customer. ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-05-07 at 12.58.00 PM.png>)
2. Once in the RDP connection, log into the client with our admin credentials. ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-05-07 at 1.01.30 PM.png>)
3. Once logged in, choose the Groups module from the palette. ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-05-07 at 1.01.45 PM.png>)
4. When you choose the groups module, it will show the list of each group that is available in the company. These groups are usually Administrators, Secretaries, and SGAdmin.                                                             ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-05-07 at 1.01.52 PM.png>)
   1. The permissions have to be changed in the Administrators and Secretaries groups. To change them, you will simply choose either group to open. When you open the group, it will bring you to the General page. You will want to choose the Area Privileges tab to access the list of permissions. When you find the facilities tab, you will want to change that to Read. Finish by hitting the save button. ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-05-07 at 1.02.22 PM.png>)
