4. From this module, you will choose the Add button. This will bring up a popup to enter your information for your new user.
   1. The first tab titled "Name" is where you will enter the first and last name of the user. ![](https://t8560266.p.clickup-attachments.com/t8560266/539da219-1884-4b10-ac93-dbe8fca36687/Screenshot%202023-04-29%20at%202.59.12%20PM.png)
   2. The second tab titled "Groups" is where you will choose what groups your user should be associated with. ![](https://t8560266.p.clickup-attachments.com/t8560266/43d1ad45-6e71-493f-9fc0-78cd02c59e25/Screenshot%202023-04-29%20at%202.59.39%20PM.png)
      1. For administrators, you will put them into the administrators and secretaries groups.&#x20;
      2. For secretaries, you will put them into the secretaries group.
   3. The next tab, "Login" is where you will create the username and password for the user. You will want to make sure the checkbox "Account Never Expires" is checked off and the "Require New Password At Next Login" checkbox is left blank. ![](https://t8560266.p.clickup-attachments.com/t8560266/930deb22-e1dc-4ac5-8d75-b2ab98c6c3c2/Screenshot%202023-04-29%20at%203.00.19%20PM.png)
      1. The usernames we set up for users are the first initial of their first name with their last name. Ex. If your user's name is John Smith, their username for the program will be jsmith.&#x20;
      2. The passwords we normally set up here for new users are: Pass123
   4. Once you have completed those three steps, you will hit the save button in the bottom right corner.&#x20;
5. To follow-up, you will want to log out of the client and test those credentials to make sure they are working correctly.&#x20;
