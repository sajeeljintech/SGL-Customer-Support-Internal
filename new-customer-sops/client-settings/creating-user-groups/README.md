# Creating User Groups

## Steps:&#x20;

1. To begin the process of creating a new user group, you will access the client and log in.&#x20;

4.  Once you have chosen that option, the popup to input your information for the group will show up.&#x20;

    1. The first tab is the General tab. In this tab, you will input your Group Name, the start date, and if applicable, the end date. This tab will eventually show the list of members that are a part of the group. If this is an active group, the checkbox in the bottom left corner needs to be checked.         ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (105).png>)
    2.  The next tab is the Area Privileges tab. This tab houses all the settings for each area and what access users in this group have to that area. ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (101).png>)

        1. For each area there is a dropbox to choose what sort of access the group will have. The 4 options to choose from are: Read, Create, Modify, and Delete. You will have to go through each area and choose the appropriate setting.

    3. The next tab is the Field Privileges tab.           ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (97).png>)
    4. The final tab is the Special Privileges tab. This tab has checkboxes that will enable the specific privilege.
