# Adding People to User Groups

## Steps:

1. Login to the client program.                                    ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (107).png>)
2. Once in the program, you will want to choose the Users module from the palatte. ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (100).png>)
3. Once in the Users module, you can either add a new user or choose an existing user to put into specific groups. Opening up an existing user, will bring you to their information. ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-05-14 at 3.47.49 PM.png>)
4. Once you are in the user you want to put in a specific group, you will choose the Groups tab. In this tab, you will see the groups that person is already a member of. ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-05-14 at 3.47.55 PM.png>)
5. To add a new group for this user, you will just click on the specific group to highlight it and then choose the add button. That will set the group in the Member Groups box. ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-05-14 at 3.52.50 PM.png>)
6. Once you have the set groups for the user, you can hit the save button in the bottom right corner.&#x20;
7. If you need to remove a user from a group, you will do the same thing to access the User's Groups. To remove the group, you will highlight it and then click the remove button. That will take the group out of that Member Groups box. Then hit the save button at the bottom.                                                           ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-05-14 at 3.53.02 PM.png>)
