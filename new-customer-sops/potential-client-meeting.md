# Potential Client Meeting

When meeting with a potential client, there are a few things we need to know about their program to best incorporate SGL.

* How many shows a year does the client run? How many entries do they usually have per show?
* How many rings are used for the show?
* Does the client have timing or scoreboard data in place?&#x20;
* Is there internet on site?
* Are they interested in video services?
* Do they have ingates/announcers for rings and would they use the live schedule?
