# Linking a Show Company with a new Server

Once you have your show company set up online and a server ready for that show company, you will follow these directions to link the two together.&#x20;

When you initially open the new server, a message will appear asking if you want this program to make changes to the computer. You will click yes to continue.&#x20;

The next box will ask you about Creating a new database. You will want to click the create button.

Once this is done, you will be able to input the Company Id. This is the Id you created in the Show Management Company settings online. Once you have entered that in, the company is linked to the server.&#x20;
