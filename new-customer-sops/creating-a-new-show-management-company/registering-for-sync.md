# Registering for Sync

An important part of setting up a new server is to register the sync. This allows information to be passed back and forth between the site and the software.&#x20;

Before you register the sync, when you log into the program, your sync wheel will show as red. If you double click the sync wheel, a screen will show up with the sync details. ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-07-13 at 12.22.24 PM.png>)

At the bottom of the screen will be the option Register for Sync. Clicking this will bring up a box to enter the password. This is our universal password: R0ckS0lidRVSP!![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-07-13 at 12.22.37 PM.png>)

Once you have entered that, the sync is registered and the system is ready to be used. Your sync wheel will now show as green instead of red.&#x20;
