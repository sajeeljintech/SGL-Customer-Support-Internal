5. When you click that button, a page will come up to enter all of the information for the new company. There are entry boxes for certain information and check boxes for specific switches on the site. The first part of creating a new company is the following 3 checkboxes. You want the Active and Online boxes checked. <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-05-06 at 1.28.22 PM.png" alt="" data-size="original">
6. The next part shows the information for the company's server. Until the server is linked, it will not show any information in this box. The server link can take place after the company is created and has a specific ID associated with it.                          ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-05-06 at 1.41.31 PM (1).png>)
7. Below the server information are entry boxes. Each show company gets a specific customer id which goes in numerical order. If the last company had an ID of 87, for example, you will create the new one with an ID of 88. You will also input the company's name.                                               ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-05-06 at 1.41.26 PM (1).png>)
   * In the Server Time Offset box, you will put the hour difference between the show company and the server. If the company is in the same time zone as the server, you will simply put 0. If the company is in PST, you would want to put -3. This ensures that the times for the show company are correct when they use the program.  ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-05-07 at 2.27.03 PM.png>)
   * In this section, you can mark when the schedule is to be sent out. For the schedule to be sent, the checkbox needs to be checked off. You can put the time of day for the schedule to be sent. ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-05-07 at 3.22.22 PM.png>)
   * The entry box for url path is the specific url that will be used for the show company.  ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (113).png>)
   * Below the URL Path are the entry boxes for logos and the image that will be used for the main SGL site and for the plugin for the company.![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-05-07 at 3.38.04 PM.png>)
   * Another setting that is controlled here is which governing organization the show company uses. Either USEF or EC will be checked and there is a box for the Login and the Password.                                        ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-05-07 at 3.40.55 PM.png>)

   * This section controls the settings for what is hidden or shown in an SGL account. Anything that is checked here, will not be an option for account holders to do in their accounts.                                              ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-05-07 at 11.42.10 AM.png>)
     * This section of switches controls other aspects of the online site and SGL accounts. To activate these switches, they need to be checked. ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-05-07 at 12.08.36 PM.png>)
     * The one dropbox in this section is to choose the governing organization. You will choose SGL for new companies.     ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (99).png>)
     * The entry boxes in this section allow you to enter the company's Facebook or other domains that are associated with the specific company. The Description box is used to provide a brief description of the company. That description is what is used on the company's SGL site.  ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-05-07 at 4.06.31 PM.png>)
9. The next section covers the plugin. If SGL is hosting the plugin you will choose SGL from the dropbox. You will enter the plugin domain and check the box to redirect to the plugin.                                                            ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-05-07 at 4.06.37 PM.png>)
