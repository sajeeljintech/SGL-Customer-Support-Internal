# Sending Out RDP/ Client Connections

## Overview:

This documentation lines out the necessary information to send to customers after their RDP and client connections are established.&#x20;

### Checklist:

1. After you have created the group and users for the RDP connection and have created the users in the client software, the information needs to be shared with the appropriate people in the show company.&#x20;
2. The following information is what needs to be sent to the new customers.
   1. RDP host name
      1. This is the host name for the connection they will make to access the software.&#x20;
         1. Each client has their own host name, the following is just an example of what that will look like. ![](https://t8560266.p.clickup-attachments.com/t8560266/e8472579-6680-4d1e-afe5-fe85402f4646/Screenshot%202023-04-29%20at%202.45.48%20PM.png)
   2. RDP credentials
      1. Each person accessing the RDP connection has their own username and password. The username is usually set up by using the first initial and the last name of each person. Normally the password set up for each user here is R3m0te123!
   3. RDP Connection Instructions
      1. We have a documentation that has the setup instructions for the RDP connection. These instructions are available for both Macs and PCs. The following link will take customers to the documentation to walk them through that process.&#x20;

   4. Client Credentials
      1. Each person accessing the client has their own username and password. Usually the username is set up as their first initial and last name. Normally the passwords set up here are Pass123
3. It is important to test all of the credentials and make sure they are working correctly before sending out the information.&#x20;
