# Accessing 4D Server

## Avocado&#x20;

Avocado is the access for all 4D servers for clients hosted on the ProxMox server that is on Bellus in Wes's barn.&#x20;

To access any one of these client servers go to: [https://avocado.showgroundsonline.com](https://avocado.showgroundsonline.com/#/)

Once you are logged in, you can select any of the customers from the list of client servers, the RDS server, or the test mahcines.&#x20;

## VNC

To access a 4D server via VNC you must have a VNC account and credentials to the customer machine which should be located in 1PASSWORD&#x20;

Open VNC, go to MY TEAMS and start typing the name of the customer or the machine that you are looking for&#x20;

Once you find the machine you are looking for you can establish your connection and then remote in to view their 4D server&#x20;

## LogMeIn

Servers that live on property for a client may also be accesible via LOGMEIN. To access you must have a LMI account as well as the desktop app installed on your machine.

To access open the desktop app and then go to the server list. Select the company server you want to access. Note: If the icon for the computer you are going to access is GREEN it means that someone else is alreay logged into that machine via LMI and you will be disconnecting them by accessing the same computer.&#x20;

Once you have the connection optioin open, you can find the proper credentials in 1PASSWORD. Once you connect you can access the server.&#x20;



## Remote Desktop with VPN

If a client has their server set up with a VPN then you also need to establish a VPN connection with IT for that client. TIEC right now is the only one that is required. You can contact dchapman@tryon.com to get connected with a tech to set up a VPN connection and once establisthed you can remote in via JUMP or Windows Remote Desktop depending on your machine. NOTE: Just like for clients ojn VPN your VPN must be open and turned on.&#x20;
