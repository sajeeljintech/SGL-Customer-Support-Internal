# Timer Node Configuration



## Local 4D Server

Requirements for setup:

* SRN IP Address
* IAM Board Port
* Ring Number

Navigate to the timer node in Showgrounds

The SGL End Point should contain: [https://showgroundslive.com](https://showgroundslive.com)

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (118).png>)

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (119).png>)

The SRN IP Address, IAM Board Port and Ring Number should all be filled in. Make sure to leave the Ryegate Forward unchecked.&#x20;

### Cloud Server

Requirements for setup:

* SRN url (traversecity.srn.showgroundslive.com for example) You will be sending to the CLOUD SRN not the Local SRN
* Ring Number

The set up is the exact same except the IAM Board Port will be 5880.&#x20;
