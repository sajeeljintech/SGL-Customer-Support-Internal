# Unlinking a User's Email

In order to fix a user's linking to their correct SGL email, they must have completed the linking with their first email. Until that initial linking is completed, their user's linking status will show as "Not linked."

When a user has completed the linking process, their Link status will show as Confirmed Link and their SGL login email will show in the user list as well.&#x20;

Once a user has a confirmed link status, if they have used the wrong email, they can be unlinked in their user. Opening a person's user will show the SGL email they are linked to.

If the user has multiple SGL accounts and wishes to change their linking to another account, their current linked account will have to be unlinked.&#x20;

When you choose the Unlink from SGL button, a popup asking if you are sure you want to link will appear.&#x20;

Choosing ok will unlink the user and when they log back into the system, they will be prompted to link their login again.&#x20;
