# Cloud Permissions



##

## Groups

Each group has a different set of permissions. There are several different groups in each show company and users have different permissions based on which groups they are in.&#x20;

Each show company has a set of 7 base groups. Some companies will have more groups, but the majority will only have the 7 groups.&#x20;



### 1. Secretaries

Every show company will have a secretaries group. The permissions set in this group are universal across show companies, so all users in the Secretaries groups will have the same permissions.&#x20;
