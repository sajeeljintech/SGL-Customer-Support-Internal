## Accessing the Email Tool

This tool is accessed in the showgroundslive.com/admin site. When the user has logged in, they will open the Communication tab and choose the Emails option.&#x20;

## Choosing Your Audience

Users can differentiate where an email is going to go. This is done by choosing the show company and the user type.&#x20;

### User Type

There are two user types. These user types are Exhibitors and Admin Users. Choosing between the two types will change the audience for the email.&#x20;



#### Exhibitor

This user type is used by the show company. Selecting this user type has to be done by choosing a specific show company. The Exhibitor type is not normally used by SGL staff.

#### Admin Users

This user type is now usable to SGAdmin. Choosing this User type will set the email to be sent to specific user groups. This User Type is also usable by the show company administrator to send emails to specific groups in their show company.&#x20;

Selecting the show company will differentiate which available groups you can send your email to.&#x20;

You can also choose to send an email to All Show Companies. When you choose your group, the email will be sent to all users in that group in all show companies.&#x20;

When choosing your User Groups for your email, you can choose a single group or multiple groups.&#x20;

Selecting your user group will then show the number of users your email will be going to and you can click to show the list of individuals.&#x20;

Once you have your user group(s) set, you can then create the email you want to send.&#x20;

Once you have finished this section, you can add attachments.&#x20;

### Sending Your Email

Once you have created your email, you can either send a test email to make sure everything looks correct, or you can send the email.



#### Test Email

If you want to send a test email, you can do this by entering the recipient's email address into the Send Test Email to: box.

When you have input your email address and choose to send the test email, the system will ask you to confirm.&#x20;

Hitting OK will send the test email and the recipient can give feedback if needed.



#### Sending the Email

When you are done with your changes to the email, you can hit the Send Email button to send the email to your chosen groups.
