# Template Groups vs. Non-Template Groups

In the new admin system, you will see two different types of groups. These groups are labeled as Template Groups and Groups.

Template groups are the set groups that each company automatically has associated. These include groups for Administrators, Secretaries, and Ingate/Announcers.

Meanwhile, Groups can be different between each company. The Groups list will show each template group being used and will also show any different groups that the company uses.&#x20;

For example, if you look at Wellington's Groups list, you can see the template groups that are used. You can also see groups for accounting and billing that are not used in other show companies.&#x20;
