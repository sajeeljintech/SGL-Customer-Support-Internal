# Updates to the Ingate/Announcer Tool - JAN 10, 2024

## Overview

We have implemented updates and improvements to the Ingate/Announcer Tool on the Cloud based on feedback from the ingate and announcers using the new tools on site. Please see below: &#x20;

**1: Order of Go Tool – Trainers with multiple trips**

This update allows the user to click the heading “Step 2: Trainers with Multiple Trips” to expand or collapse data for a more efficient view.&#x20;

_Expanded List View:_

&#x20;**2: Expanded View of Classes**&#x20;

Previously, there were only 11 lines viewable at a time on the OOG this has been updated so that all trips can be viewed; all rows will be viewable without scrolling within the page.&#x20;

&#x20;**5: Simple Scheduler – Enter Button Functional**

In the new tools we have added the functionality back for the Enter key stroke to work from the keypad (the 10 digit keypad on the right side of the users keyboard)&#x20;

**6: Ingate/Announcer Scratch History**

Ingate/announcer scratch actions will now be logged in an entry and will be available in the office (Client)  when viewing history for entry.
