# Assigning Permissions

Assigning permissions are done in the Roles section. Opening the Roles section of the menu will show all of the Roles in the system.&#x20;

Opening each role will show the groups that the role is assigned to. To change the permissions to a role, you will need to go to the View/Assign Permissions button.

Choosing the View/Assign Permissions option will open the area to set permissions. There are 3 different sections of permissions. These are PHP Admin, Admin, and 4D/Cloud.

#### PHP Admin

The PHP Admin section controls the permissions for sections in the current web administration.

In the PHP section, each area has a dropbox that has None or Write. If the box is set to none, the permission is not allowed. If it is set to write, that area is enabled.&#x20;

#### Admin

The Admin section controls the permissions for the new cloud admin site.&#x20;

In the Admin section, each dropbox includes 4 different permission settings. These are None, Read, Write, and Delete.&#x20;

1. With None set, the area is not accessible for the group it is set to.
2. If Read is set, people in the Group with these permissions can only read the set area.
3. If Write is set, people in that Group can edit the specific area.
4. With Delete set, users can delete items in that area.

#### 4D/Cloud

The 4D/Cloud section controls the permissions for the client program and what the users can and cannot access.

Each area in this section has a dropbox and some areas also have specific check boxes. The dropbox here is similar to those found in the Admin section with the None, Read, Write and Delete options.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (93).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once you have gone through each section and set the permissions you want that specific role to have, you will choose the Assign button at the bottom.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (94).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This will save the permissions for that specific role. You will then save the role to save the assigned permissions. Each role is assigned to different groups.&#x20;
