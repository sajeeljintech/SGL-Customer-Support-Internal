# Roles

Accessing each set of roles is done by choosing the Roles tab in the User Management section of the menu.&#x20;

New roles can be added in this section and Roles that are not needed can be deleted.

Opening a role will show you each of the user groups that the role has been assigned to. Roles can be assigned to multiple groups.

From this section, you can open each of the groups, or you can view the assigned permissions to the role. Opening the permissions, you can also edit the assigned permissions for that role.&#x20;

Once you have made your changes to the role's permissions, you will choose the Assign option at the bottom of the Permissions box.&#x20;

Once you have assigned the new permissions, you will also need to save the role. Hitting the assign button will take you back to the main role page. On this page, you will need to choose the save option at the bottom.
