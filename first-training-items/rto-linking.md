# RTO/Linking

New customers need to understand how RTO account and SGL accounts are linked.&#x20;

A show company database should only have one RTO account for a person. Having multiple RTO accounts creates confusion if entries get associated to an RTO account that is not linked to the person's SGL account.&#x20;

Linking an RTO account to an SGL account allows exhibitors access to their entries. If there are issues with an exhibitor not being able to see their entries in their account, those issues should be directed to ShowGrounds support.&#x20;
